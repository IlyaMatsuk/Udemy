You will write a program which is similar to the second example in the lecture, but without using a packaged task. (For reference, the code used in the lecture is attached as a downloadable resource)

Your program will create two threads. The task function for the first thread will add together its arguments and store the result in a promise object.

The second thread will display the result of the addition performed by the first thread.
